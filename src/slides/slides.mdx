<Notes>

- How was hosting done in "the before times"?

- Dedicated servers:
  - physical machines—hetzner, rsaweb, afrihost, etc
  - Pricey
  - Mission to maintain
  - Cumbersome to set up
  - All your responsibility

- Virtual Machines
  - Cheap—multiple VMs run on a single server
  - The industry standard today
  - Run by industry leaders like Google/Amazon/Microsoft
  - Need to allocate resources to each VM running on a server
  - Wasted resources

- Containers
  - Don't need to setup multiple different components everytime you want to spin up a new instance
  - This includes local development—write once, run anywhere
  - Faster startup (VMs can take minutes to start up, containers take seconds)
  - Deployments are easier; Kubernetes takes care of it for us. No more tedious release pipelines to bring down the stack, copy files around, bring up the VMs, interrupt up-time, etc.
  - Resource management is done automagically

- Serverless
  - Even cheaper than containers—only pay when your code is executing
  - Better for individual functions that don't need to run the whole time; larger applications still have finer control when using containerization
  - Functions need to warn up before first run

# Images? Containers? Pods? Nodes? Orchestration?

<Notes>

- Q: What's the difference between Docker Containers and VMs?

- Docker is a lightweight, portable process that can run on any OS

- As the logo suggests, it's like a cargo ship that carries around all of the components necessary for running your software

- Docker allows us to create an image of our application and all its settings, and spin up the entire stack instantly

- Super fast

</Notes>

# What is Docker?

<Notes>

- We've all been here: build something that only works on your machine
- Ignoring colleagues' complaints when it doesn't work on their machine
- By using docker, everyone is effectively running on the same OS

</Notes>

# Why Docker?

<Steps>

- "It worked on my computer, I swear!"
- Faster onboarding & environment setup
- Version control is built-in
- Rollbacks are trivial

</Steps>

---

<Notes>

- Blueprint for building your application
- Instructioons for new instances to be spun up
- Usually the commands you would run locally on your machine/VM to install depencies/create executables

</Notes>

# Dockerfiles

<div style={{ fontSize: '1rem', padding: '2rem', backgroundColor: "var(--theme-ui-colors-text,#003d48)"}}>

```

COPY package*.json ./

RUN npm install

COPY . .

EXPOSE 4000

CMD ["npx", "ts-node", "src/index.ts"]

# Spin up a docker container

<div style={{ fontSize: '1rem', padding: '2rem', backgroundColor: "var(--theme-ui-colors-text,#003d48)"}}>

```bash
# Build our image
docker build -t djbotha/shopping-list:latest .

# Start a container from our image
docker run -p 4000:4000 djbotha/shopping-list
```

</div>

<Notes>

- Quickly want to demo this functionality

- Spinning up a new environment takes all of 10 seconds
- This just lets us run one instance, but what if we wanted to do deploy our app?
- Docker solves our build step, but not our deployment step

</Notes>

# Demo

<Notes>

- Q: Anyone want to guess what container orchestration is?
- Managing these individual "processes" (containers) are no different to managing multiple VMs/instances of an API
- If you wanted to ship this as-is, you'll need to:
  - hook up your own Load Balancers
  - spin up new instances as required
  - add your own monitoring
  - etc

</Notes>

# ✨Container Orchestration✨

<Steps>

- Provisioning & deployment
- Resource allocation
- Container availability
- Auto scaling
- Load balancing
- Networking
- Monitoring container health
- ...and the list goes on

</Steps>

<Notes>

- The official definition: "Kubernetes is an open-source container-orchestration system for automating computer application deployment, scaling, and management"
- K8s allows us to write Yaml config files containing all of the details of our deployment/"how to run the application"

<Notes>

- I'll go through this one quickly to not bore anyone
- Deployment manifest describes the desired state of our pods:
  - We want a new deploymment called `shopping-list-deployment`
  - Call the app `shopping-list`
  - specify that we want 4 replicas (instances)
  - each of our pods needs to be built from the `djbotha/shopping-list` docker image
  - for each of the pods, we want to specify a health endpoint
  - we want to expose port 4000 to the rest of the network (if we had other services that had to talk to this service, they would connect to this port)

- We can add environment variables here for our containers (e.g. database credentials)
- These files tend to get pretty big, so they're quite daunting at first

</Notes>

# Deployment Manifest

<div style={{ fontSize: '1rem', overflow: 'auto', maxHeight: 800, padding: '2rem', backgroundColor: "var(--theme-ui-colors-text,#003d48)" }}>

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: shopping-list-deployment
  labels:
    app: shopping-list
spec:
  replicas: 4
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: shopping-list
  template:

      labels:
        app: shopping-list
    spec:
      containers:

```

</div>

<Notes>

- Here's our service manifest:
  - We want to create a new service called `shopping-list-service`
  - It will use the `shopping-list` application that we've defined in our `deployment`
  - `type: LoadBalancer`  exposes this service to the outside world
  - specify communication ports

</Notes>

# Service Manifest

<div style={{ fontSize: '1rem', overflow: 'auto', maxHeight: 800, padding: '2rem', backgroundColor: "var(--theme-ui-colors-text,#003d48)" }}>

```yaml
apiVersion: v1

<Notes>

- With just this one command we can spin up our API
- This will run through our deployment configuration
- Pulls the latest docker image
- Starts N pods with the specified config

</Notes>

# Spin up a cluster

<div style={{ fontSize: '1rem', padding: '2rem', backgroundColor: "var(--theme-ui-colors-text,#003d48)"}}>

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

</div>

<Notes>

- This allows us to rebuild & push our docker image, then trigger a new rollout of this image

</Notes>

# Push an update

<div style={{ fontSize: '1rem', padding: '2rem', backgroundColor: "var(--theme-ui-colors-text,#003d48)"}}>

```bash
kubectl rollout restart deployment.apps/shopping-list-deployment
```

</div>

---


# Scale on the fly

<div style={{ fontSize: '1rem', padding: '2rem', backgroundColor: "var(--theme-ui-colors-text,#003d48)"}}>

```bash
kubectl scale --replicas=4 deployment.apps/shopping-list-deployment
```

</div>

---

<Notes>

- Say we made a mistake when updating our config
- We can rollback to a previous version

</Notes>

# Rollbacks


<div style={{ fontSize: '1rem', padding: '2rem', backgroundColor: "var(--theme-ui-colors-text,#003d48)"}}>

```bash
kubectl rollout undo deployment.apps/shopping-list-deployment
```
